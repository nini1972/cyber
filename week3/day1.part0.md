# Day 1 Part 0: Getting Started with the Cybersecurity Analyzer

Welcome to Week 3 of AI in Production! Over the next two days, you'll deploy a real AI application to both Azure and Google Cloud Platform. By the end of Day 2, you'll have hands-on experience with modern cloud deployment practices used in production environments.

## What You'll Build

The **Cybersecurity Analyzer** is an AI-powered web application that analyzes Python code for security vulnerabilities. It combines:
- OpenAI's latest models for intelligent code analysis
- Semgrep for static security scanning
- A React/Next.js frontend
- A FastAPI backend
- Docker containerization
- Cloud deployment with Terraform

This is a real-world application architecture that you'll see in production environments!

## Section 1: Project Setup

### Clone the Repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, do so now:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ed-donner/cyber.git
```

### Open in Cursor

1. Launch Cursor
2. Click **File** → **New Window**
3. Click **Open Folder**
4. Navigate to and select the `cyber` folder you just cloned
5. Click **Open**

You should now see the project structure in Cursor's file explorer on the left.

Take a moment to explore the structure:
- `frontend/` - Next.js React application
- `backend/` - FastAPI Python server
- `terraform/` - Infrastructure as Code configurations
- `week3/` - These guides you're reading!

## Section 2: Semgrep Setup

Semgrep is a powerful static analysis tool that finds security vulnerabilities in code. Let's set up your account and get an API token.

### Create Your Semgrep Account

1. Visit https://semgrep.dev
2. Click **"Try Semgrep for free"** 
3. Click **"Continue with GitHub"**
4. Authorize Semgrep to connect with your GitHub account

### Generate Your API Token

Once logged into Semgrep:

1. Click **Settings** (bottom left corner of the dashboard)
2. In the main navigation, click **Tokens**
3. Click **"Create New Token"**
4. Configure the token:
   - **Name**: `cyber-analyzer` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Scopes**: Check both:
     - ✅ **Agent (CI)**
     - ✅ **Web API**
5. Click **"Create"**
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately! You won't be able to see it again.
   - It will look something like: `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...`

Keep this token handy - you'll need it in the next section.

## Section 3: Environment Configuration

Now let's create your `.env` file with the necessary API keys.

### Create the .env File

1. In Cursor, right-click on the project root (the `cyber` folder in the file explorer)
2. Select **"New File"**
3. Name it exactly `.env` (yes, starting with a dot)
4. Add the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=your-semgrep-token-here
```

5. Replace the placeholder values:
   - `your-openai-key-here` - Your OpenAI API key from previous weeks
   - `your-semgrep-token-here` - The Semgrep token you just created
6. Save the file (`Cmd+S` on Mac, `Ctrl+S` on Windows/Linux)

⚠️ **Security Note**: The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed to Git. Never share these keys publicly!

### Verify Your Keys

Your `.env` file should look similar to this (but with your actual keys):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abc123xyz...
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...
```

## Section 4: Test Locally Without Docker

Let's verify everything works by running the application locally.

### Prerequisites Check

First, ensure you have the required tools:

```bash
# Check Node.js (should be 20+)
node --version

# Check uv is installed (Python package manager)
uv --version
```

If `uv` is not installed:
```bash
# Mac/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (in PowerShell as admin)
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Start the Backend Server

Open a terminal in Cursor (Terminal → New Terminal) and run:

```bash
cd backend
uv run server.py
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The backend API is now running at http://localhost:8000

### Start the Frontend Development Server

Open a **new terminal** in Cursor (keep the backend running) and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev
```

You should see output like:
```
  ▲ Next.js 15.x.x
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env

✓ Ready in 2.1s
```

### Test the Application

1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
   
   **Important**: Use the `http://localhost:3000` URL, not the Network URL that Next.js displays. The application is configured to work with localhost in development mode.

2. You should see the Cybersecurity Analyzer interface
3. Click **"Choose File"** and select the `airline.py` file from the project root
   - This file contains intentional security vulnerabilities for testing
4. Click **"Analyze Code"**
5. You should see multiple security vulnerabilities detected!

### Stopping the Servers

When you're done testing:
- Backend: Press `Ctrl+C` in the backend terminal
- Frontend: Press `Ctrl+C` in the frontend terminal

---

## Section 5: Test with Docker

Now let's test the containerized version - exactly what we'll deploy to the cloud!

### Prerequisites Check

Ensure Docker is installed and running:

```bash
docker --version
docker ps  # Should not error
```

If Docker isn't installed, download it from https://docker.com/get-started

### Build the Docker Image

In a terminal at the project root:

```bash
docker build -t cyber-analyzer .
```

This will take 2-5 minutes the first time as it:
- Downloads base images
- Installs Python dependencies
- Builds the Next.js frontend
- Packages everything together

You should see output ending with:
```
Successfully tagged cyber-analyzer:latest
```

### Run the Container

Start the containerized application:

```bash
docker run --rm --name cyber-analyzer -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env cyber-analyzer
```

Breaking down this command:
- `--rm`: Remove container when stopped
- `--name cyber-analyzer`: Name for easy reference
- `-p 8000:8000`: Map port 8000
- `--env-file .env`: Load environment variables
- `cyber-analyzer`: Image name

You'll see the server startup logs:
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Test the Container

1. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. Test by uploading the `airline.py` file from the project root
3. You should see the same security analysis results as before

### Stop the Container

When you're done testing, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the container. It will be automatically removed (due to `--rm` flag).

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" or dependency errors
- Ensure you're using `uv run` for the backend (not just `python`)
- For frontend, run `npm install` before `npm run dev`

### "Port already in use"
- Check for other processes: `lsof -i :8000` (Mac/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :8000` (Windows)
- Kill any conflicting processes or use different ports

### Docker build fails
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check available disk space: `docker system df`
- Clean up if needed: `docker system prune -a` (warning: removes all unused images)

### Environment variables not working
- Verify `.env` file is in project root (not in backend/ or frontend/)
- Check there are no spaces around the `=` in your `.env` file
- Ensure no quotes around the values unless they contain spaces
