## Creating Your GCP Account

### GCP Free Trial
1. Navigate to https://cloud.google.com/free
2. Click **"Get started for free"**
3. Sign in with your Google account (or create one)
4. You'll need to provide:
   - Country
   - Account type (Individual)
   - A credit card (for identity verification - you won't be charged)
   - Phone number for verification
5. You'll receive:
   - $300 credit valid for 90 days
   - Always Free tier services (even after trial ends)
   - No auto-charge after trial ends

> **Note**: Unlike Azure, GCP will NOT automatically charge your card when the trial ends. You must manually upgrade to a paid account.

⚠️ **Important**: After creating your account, you'll be redirected to the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com

## Understanding GCP's Structure

Before we create resources, let's understand GCP's hierarchy:

```
Google Account (Your Gmail)
  └── Organization (optional, for businesses)
      └── Billing Account (Your payment method)
          └── Project (e.g., "cyber-analyzer")
              └── Resources (Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, etc.)
```

Think of:
- **Billing Account**: Your payment method (can fund multiple projects)
- **Project**: A container for all your resources (similar to Azure's Resource Group)
- **Resources**: The actual services you create

---

## Creating Your First Project

GCP requires a project to organize resources. Let's create one:

1. In the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. At the top of the page, click the project dropdown (might say "My First Project")
3. Click **"NEW PROJECT"** in the dialog
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Project name**: `cyber-analyzer`
   - **Organization**: Leave the default value
   - **Location**: Leave the default value
   
   💡 **Note**: GCP will auto-generate a unique Project ID based on your project name (shown in gray text under the name field). Write this down - you'll need it for CLI commands!

5. Click **"CREATE"**
6. Wait about 30 seconds for creation
7. Make sure your new project is selected in the top dropdown

🎉 You've created your first project!

## Setting Up Billing

Even with free credits, you need to link your billing account to the project:

1. In the Console, click the **"☰"** menu (top-left)
2. Navigate to **"Billing"**
3. If prompted, link your billing account to the project
4. Verify you see your $300 credit balance

---

## Setting Up Cost Management

Let's set up budget alerts to avoid surprises:

1. In the Console menu **"☰"**, navigate to **"Billing"**
2. Click **"Budgets & alerts"** in the left menu
3. Click **"CREATE BUDGET"**
4. Configure your budget:
   - **Name**: `Monthly Training Budget`
   - **Projects**: Select `cyber-analyzer`
   - Click **"Next"**
5. Set the amount:
   - **Budget type**: Specified amount
   - **Amount**: `$10`
   - **Time period**: Monthly
   - Click **"Next"**
6. Set up alerts:
   - Default thresholds are good (50%, 90%, 100%)
   - Check **"Email alerts to billing admins"**
   - Optionally add your email under "Email recipients"
   - Click **"Finish"**

✅ Now you'll get email alerts before spending too much!

## Installing Google Cloud CLI

The gcloud CLI is essential for deployment operations and working with containerized applications.

### Windows Users

Option 1 - Using the installer:
1. Download the installer from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#windows
2. Run the downloaded `GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe`
3. Follow the installation wizard (accept all defaults)
4. The installer will automatically open a new command prompt

Option 2 - Using PowerShell (requires admin):
```powershell
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe", "$env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe")
& $env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe
```

### Mac Users

Option 1 - Using Homebrew (if you have it):
```bash
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

Option 2 - Direct install:
```bash
# Download and run the install script
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
# Restart your shell
exec -l $SHELL
```

### Linux Users

For most distributions:
```bash
# Download and run the install script
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
# Restart your shell
exec -l $SHELL
```

For Ubuntu/Debian with apt:
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli
```

### Initialize gcloud (All Platforms)

1. Open a new terminal/command prompt
2. Run:
```bash
gcloud init
```

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Choose **"Y"** to log in
   - Your browser will open - sign in with your Google account
   - Choose your project (`cyber-analyzer`)
   - Choose a default region when prompted:
     - US: `us-central1` or `us-east1`
     - Europe: `europe-west1` or `europe-north1`
     - Asia: `asia-southeast1` or `asia-northeast1`
   
   💡 **Pro tip**: Remember this region! We'll use it for Cloud Run.

---

## Verifying Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working:

### Using Google Cloud Console
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Ensure `cyber-analyzer` is selected in the project dropdown
3. Click the **"☰"** menu and go to **"Cloud Run"**
4. You should see an empty list (that's correct!)

### Using gcloud CLI
Run these commands:
```bash
# Show current configuration
gcloud config list

# List available projects
gcloud projects list

# Show current project
gcloud config get-value project

# Test API access
gcloud services list --enabled
```

You should see:
- Your project ID (`cyber-analyzer-xxxxx`)
- Your selected region
- A list of enabled APIs

### Enable Required APIs
Cloud Run needs specific APIs enabled. Run:
```bash
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
```

This enables:
- Cloud Run API (for deployments)
- Container Registry API (for storing images)
- Cloud Build API (for building containers)

## What's Next?

Congratulations! Your GCP account is now ready. You have:
- ✅ A GCP account with $300 in credits
- ✅ A project configured for our application
- ✅ Budget alerts configured
- ✅ gcloud CLI installed and authenticated
- ✅ Required APIs enabled

In the next guide, we'll:
1. Push our Docker image to Artifact Registry
2. Deploy to Cloud Run
3. Configure environment variables securely
4. Set up a custom domain (optional)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors
- Make sure you selected the correct project
- Ensure APIs are enabled (see Enable Required APIs section)
- Try: `gcloud auth login` to refresh credentials

### Billing account issues
- Free trial requires a valid credit card
- Billing must be linked to the project
- Check: `gcloud beta billing projects describe cyber-analyzer`

### CLI installation problems
- Windows: Run installer as Administrator
- Mac/Linux: Ensure you have curl installed
- All: Restart your terminal after installation

### Project ID vs Project Name
- Project Name: Human-friendly (e.g., "cyber-analyzer")
- Project ID: Globally unique (e.g., "cyber-analyzer-123456")
- Use Project ID in commands

### Still stuck?
- GCP Console has a **"?"** help button (top-right)
- Cloud Shell (in-browser terminal) is available as backup
- Community support at https://cloud.google.com/community

## Cost Saving Tips 💰

1. **Cloud Run charges only when running** - perfect for learning!
2. **Delete unused resources** immediately after labs
3. **Use minimum instances** (we'll set this to 0)
4. **Monitor costs weekly** in the Billing section
5. **Set up budget alerts** (which you just did!)

### Free Tier Highlights
Even after your $300 credit expires, you get:
- Cloud Run: 2 million requests/month free
- Cloud Storage: 5GB free
- Cloud Build: 120 build-minutes/day free

Remember: Unlike Azure Container Apps, Cloud Run can truly scale to zero, meaning zero cost when not in use!
